## 🚀 Overview

This project features a "Hidden Search" functionality where a search input field expands when clicked, providing a smooth and interactive experience. It's perfect for minimalist designs where space is a premium.

### 🎯 Project Goals:
- Implement a button with a search icon using Font Awesome.
- Use JavaScript to trigger an event that expands the search input field when the button is clicked.
- Add CSS transitions to smoothly increase the input field's width and move the button using `transform: translateX()`.
- Ensure that clicking the button again shrinks the input field back to its original size.
